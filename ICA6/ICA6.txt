ICA6 had these instructions:

#1. Please read the titanic.csv file and assign it to a data frame called df.
#2. Use the summary function to get a statistical summary of your data frame. Please report for which columns you get meaningful statistical summaries such as mean and median.
#3. Assign the rows that don't have NA value for the Age column from df to df2. (Hint: is.na( ) )
#4. Assign those rows which have Survived passenger under the age of 30 to another data fram called younger. (Please try data frame slicing, but know that subset() is another option)
#5  Assign those rows which have Survived passengers at the age of 30 and above to another data fram called older.

#Additional info for you to study and try later in your own time:
#library(tidyr)
#library(dplyr)
#df %>% drop_na() %>% count(Age>=30 & Survived==1)
#df %>% drop_na() %>% count(Age<30 & Survived==1)

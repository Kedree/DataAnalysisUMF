This does not take into account the cumulative probability of all the other asteroids in the sentry database nor all the unobserved asteroids. There is not a single asteroid with greather than 0.00001% chance of impacting the Earth with a Torino scale greater than 0 which correlates to essentially no risk according to this NASA [poster](https://web.archive.org/web/20041230031246/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/torino_scale1.html).\n",

        "NASA's planetary defense team could potentially save millions of lives by detecting and deflecting an asteroid of terrifying capacity with a project like DART. The sooner we find such an asteroid the more time we have to save lives or prevent mass evacuation which could seriously harm the local economy. NASA needs to have at least 3-10 years if even considering a project like DART on a dangerous asteroid as just a bump of half a centimeter per second can throw off an asteroid's impact from about 10 years out.\n",

Space based telescopes are also better at warning of Long Period Comets which are near immpossible to catalogue beforehand and could be devastating. A space telescope would optimally cost about 3-4x that of a ground based telescope while providing a similar amount of calculated risk after 10 years of running: ~\\$250M vs ~\\$950M. You may have noticed a problem; this is somewhere between 2-7 times their current budget! Next year the project is deemed to have only about $110M exaserbating the problem further."
